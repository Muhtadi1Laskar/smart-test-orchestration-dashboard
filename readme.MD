- Shared browser cache for instant launch  
- Timeout protection & resource safety  
- `npm ci --ignore-scripts` for security

### 📈 Observability & Insights
- Pass/fail history per test  
- Duration trends & performance baselines  
- Flaky test detection (failed inconsistently)  
- Full artifact retention: screenshots, videos, traces

### 🛠️ Developer Experience

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Frontend (React/Vanilla)
       ↓
Express.js Backend
       ↓
├── GitHub Cloner
├── Dependency Installer (npm ci)
├── Playwright Test Runner
├── Artifact Manager
└── MongoDB (for run history)
```

All test execution happens in **temporary, isolated workspaces** — your server stays clean and secure.

---

## 📦 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
PORT=3000
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=C:\\playwright-browsers  # Windows
# PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/home/user/.cache/playwright-browsers  # Linux/macOS
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/testpilot  # optional
```

> 💡 On Windows, use **double backslashes** in `.env`

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- Never runs `npm install` — uses `npm ci --ignore-scripts`  
- All user-provided repos are cloned to temporary directories  
- Browser binaries are pre-installed and reused (no per-run download)  
- No sensitive data leaves your server

> ⚠️ For public deployments, add authentication and rate limiting.
